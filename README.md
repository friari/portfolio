## Description

### Purpose

The purpose of my portfolio website is to have a hub on the internet where I can get my name as a web developer out into the world by showing my sense of design, the projects I have worked on and linking to other sites where I have hosted content of my own, such as github.

### Functionality/Features

* Sleek and minimal design
* Clickable dropdown menu from the hamburger icon in the top right of the page, built in pure css, takes to different areas of the site (as does scrolling)
* 'A' logo in the top right returns user to home page when clicked
* Heading on home page animates in from an opacity of 0 to an opacity of 1
* Different site configuration for mobile use vs desktop use, achieved through css breakpoints
* About section, with a small introduction to who I am and my study and work history. Div for the info has overflow scroll
* Work section, displaying the projects I have worked on. Will add to this with each project I have a hand in making
* Contact Me section, with my email address, links to my github and my linkedin

## Design Documentation

### Design Process

* I had an idea for how I wanted my site layout to work before anything else
* After this, I spent a while coming up with the perfect color pallet. I wanted cool, sleek colors to show sophistication.  
![color scheme](./docs/portfolio_colour_scheme.png)  
* I wire framed by website. First I did a low fi wire frame on an A4 sheet of paper (this wasunfortunately lost due to water damage). Then I did a more hi-fi wire frame on butcher's paper.
* I found stock images on pexels that I could use for the background images of my website. I was looking for minimal textures that would complement the colour scheme of my website.
* I looked for my fonts on Google Fonts. I was looking for simple, sans-serif fonts that had a sleek look that would fit in with my vision. The fonts I chose were Saira Extra Condensed for the headings and menus and Montserrat for the rest.

### Wire Frames

### Usability Considerations

I designed my website to be stark and minimal and therefore increase usability via reduction of clutter. Added alt tags for pertinent images for the benefit of a screen reader.
