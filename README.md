## Description

### Purpose

The purpose of my portfolio website is to have a hub on the internet where I can get my name as a web developer out into the world by showing my sense of design, the projects I have worked on and linking to other sites where I have hosted content of my own, such as github.

### Functionality/Features

* Sleek and minimal design
* Clickable dropdown menu from the hamburger icon in the top right of the page, built in pure css, takes to different areas of the site (as does scrolling)
* 'A' logo in the top right returns user to home page when clicked
* Heading on home page animates in from an opacity of 0 to an opacity of 1
* Different site configuration for mobile use vs desktop use, achieved through css breakpoints
* About section, with a small introduction to who I am and my study and work history. Div for the info has overflow scroll
* Work section, displaying the projects I have worked on. Will add to this with each project I have a hand in making
* Contact Me section, with my email address, links to my github and my linkedin

## Design Documentation

### Design Process

* I had an idea for how I wanted my site layout to work before anything else
* Created a pinterest mood board for inspiration  
![pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com.au/afriedgut/dev-portfolio/)
* After this, I spent a while coming up with the perfect color pallet. I wanted cool, sleek colors to show sophistication.  
![color scheme](./docs/portfolio_colour_scheme.png)  
* I wire framed by website. First I did a low fi wire frame on an A4 sheet of paper (this wasunfortunately lost due to water damage). Then I did a more hi-fi wire frame on butcher's paper.
* I found stock images on pexels that I could use for the background images of my website. I was looking for minimal textures that would complement the colour scheme of my website.
* I looked for my fonts on Google Fonts. I was looking for simple, sans-serif fonts that had a sleek look that would fit in with my vision. The fonts I chose were Saira Extra Condensed for the headings and menus and Montserrat for the rest.

### Wire Frames

### Usability Considerations

I designed my website to be stark and minimal and therefore increase usability via reduction of clutter. Added alt tags for pertinent images for the benefit of a screen reader.

## Short Answer Q&A

### Describe key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today

Since the 1980s, the internet has grown and become an integral element of western society. In 1983, TCP/IP, the communication protocols for how data travels across the web, became standard for internet protocol. In 1993, HTML was released. One year later the internet went public. In 1995 came Javascript and then a year later, CSS. In 1997, ISPs began to appear. Wi-Fi became standardised in 1999 and in 2001 the first internet cell phone was released by Blackberry. 2005 saw the launch of Youtube. The internet was growing at such a rate that by 2008, the google index reached 1 Trillion URLs. Today, the internet has afforded humanity greater access to information than we have ever had before, with the advent of technologies such as cloud computing.

### Define and describe the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers

A network in its purest form is a series of computers connected to share data. A web server is a connection hub that receives requests from computers connected to a network. The information is processed, and shows up in our web browser, which is a software that allows the user to access information from the internet. A domain is the name of the site we are on (that comes after https://) that is representative of the website's IP address. The way the browser accesses the domain is through something called DNS, which stands for Domain Name Server and function as a means for the computer to find the domain's real address so it can retrieve the website for the user.

### Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today 

The advent of social media and the general communicative function of the internet has forever changed the way that people communicate with each other. Gone are the days of telegrams, chunky phone books and home phone lines (these still exist but are increasingly rare.) These days, people are simply saving contact's numbers on their phone, so fewer people are going out of their way to remember phone numbers. Invitations to events are sent online, via facebook or other forms of social media, and these are the platforms through which people are making their social arrangements. Text messaging is a major means of communication and people are actually socialising less face-to-face. It is easier than it has ever been before to connect to a wide international network of people, and lots of people are finding their 'tribe' on the internet.
