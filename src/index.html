                <p>Hi! In case you haven't picked up on it yet, my name is Ari.</p>
                <p>I'm a full-stack developer with an eye for design and a penchant for being a weirdo.</p>
                <p>I love being a web dev. It's a role I am grateful to possess.</p>
                <p>I wasn't always a developer. For the first 18 years of my life I was preoccupied with childhood, and then adolescence.
                    While I did harbor an interest in tech even then, the trials and tribulations of puberty kept me at bay.
                    Also, I'll freely admit that for a long time, I had absolutely no idea what I wanted to do.
                    Graduation came and went, and after a year spent adventuring and volunteering abroad post-high-school, 
                    I began studying film at AFTRS in 2013. Over the next few years I continued to follow that thread, 
                    starting a media degree at Macquarie in 2014 before transferring back to AFTRS the next year to commence a degree in screen.</p>
                <p>It took me a couple years to realise that while I was a huge film buff, I needed something that would challenge me and keep me on my toes.
                    Here is where my journey with programming begun. Hugely drawn to the dynamism in the tech industry, I took some online classes on computer science 
                    and coding, and shortly thereafter I enrolled in Coder Academy's Fast Track Coding Course. I couldn't be happier with the path I am currently on, 
                    and I look forward to continuing this exciting journey that lies ahead.
